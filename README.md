### Description 
In this hack-A-Thing I had used my previous experience to expand upon material ui and create an online complaint forum for dartmouth. Here there is a title and a description category where students, professors, deans, or residential operations workers can file a complaint and send it out to the forum. 

### What I learned 

The biggest thing I learned in this session is figuring out how to link different pages together, and how to create different pages to link together. Small things I have learned is how to code up a complaint system, aka how to make grids associated with specific text and then display them on another webpage, along with learning how to create components for different webpages( notecards). I had utilized typography, buttons, and the grid system from my last expedition, and expanded upon them by creating a cohesive set of pages interacting with one another. 


### What didnt work/shortcomings 
So far, when I delete a post and then refresh, the card does not remove itself, so I need to figure out why thats happening. Apart from that I believe the website is fairly responsive, maybe in the future I would alter layouts and themes, as it looks alittle plain 

### Inspiration/ opinions 
I really enjoyed material-ui and think its essential for everyone to learn for coding any website in the future. It intuitly adds interactive components to any page which is extremely necessary currently. I believe I will use material-ui to create a website for whatever product I end up making.
